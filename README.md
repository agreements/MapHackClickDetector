# MapHackClickDetector

This is a tool for detecting the selection of invisible heroes by maphack in Warcraft III. I rebulit this project using VS2015. This project supports Windows 7 32-bit and Warcraft III 1.24b. 

Usage:
Build using VS2015, then copy MHCDDLL.dll into the same folder with war3.exe. Start war3 and MHCDGUI, then click "Initialize". If everything is OK, "Started" will be shown in the MHCDGUI.

Probably you have seen the author suwuhao in some Chinese website. That is my used name. You can contact suwuhao@yahoo.com to verify.
